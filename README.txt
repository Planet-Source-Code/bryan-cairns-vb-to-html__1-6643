VB to HTML aka the Documentor

This program is by no means complete.

Use this program to open a Visual Basic Project File (*.vbp) and it will read all then files in your project and print out documentation in HTML.

This program may seem to lock up - it is just thinking.
If anyone knows how to speed it up, please let me know.

I did not write all of this program, I used some functions from planet source code
http://www.planet-source-code.com

So if you use this program please mention my name in conjunction with the other authors mentioned in the source code.
